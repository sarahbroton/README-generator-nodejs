## Project Description
Do you long for a quick way to generate a README.md while using NODE?  Using this generator will make creating beauitful, easy to read README's. (See what I did there? üòè)  This generator will help keep you on track by asking you the very important‚ùóquestions while creating a readme document. See below for specific prompted questions.  

* This project creates a sample README generated by using NODE.js.  

## User Story
AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, 
Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options

THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

WHEN I enter my GitHub username

THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

WHEN I enter my email address

THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents

THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
